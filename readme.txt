This repository contains the source code for the Interactive Graphics course, held by Prof. Marco Schaerf at the La Sapienza University.


This code is fully made by Dario Benvenuti, using HTML, JavaScript and native-only WebGl.

The main goal was to show what was learnt from the course about rendering, lighting, texture mapping, animations, hierarchical structures and user interactions.

I decided to build a very simple mini-game, in which the user can move a little spider in a quite dark maze, collecting objectives.
